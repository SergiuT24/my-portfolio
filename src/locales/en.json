	"fifa": "Fifa Tournaments",
	"fifa-about": "My tournament website was my first major project in React, and it’s the one I’ve worked on the most. I built a complex platform for 50-100 players who compete throughout the year. I implemented data retrieval from AWS buckets and integrated it into the leaderboard table. Additionally, I developed a Discord bot running on an AWS server, which allows players to submit their scores and automatically updates the standings. This project has been a great learning experience in frontend development, API integration, and real-time data management.",

	"horoscope-about": "Zodiak was my first project built with Vite, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it was also the first one for which I purchased a domain and made publicly available for horoscope enthusiasts.

This project was a great learning experience in API integration, serverless functions, and web performance optimization.",
